Docker is a tool to run application in isolated env similar as VM. The app runs in same env , it works on all the platform, like my comp , on server and my other fellow developers too. We don't have to install again the dependencies . Docker has containers but its not a vm.
They only use the host machine kernel. The docker uses Linus file system. A container can start in seconds and less space and less memory. A container is a running instance of an image. (snapsot) It has OS software application code all bundled in a file.
It has docker file which has steps to create that image.
We build the docker file and build that to make image and then make container for that image.
Kubernetes help docker container to scale.

In Vm it has its own OS and runs with heavy process and takes lots of process speed. Whereas docker is light weight and it also has less isolation. 

Docker saves lot of resources , no Vm is needed as it is runs on host on OS. VM are very good in isolating system resources unlike docker. Docker isolate individual application and not the complete systems .
